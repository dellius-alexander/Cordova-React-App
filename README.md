<h2><a id="cordova">Why Apache Cordova?</a></h2>

`Apache Cordova` is a `mobile development platform` that allows you to create `cross-platform
mobile applications` using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a set of APIs that allow
you to access native device features, such as the camera, GPS, and accelerometer, from
within your web app. These APIs are implemented as JavaScript libraries, which can be
included in your web app and accessed from within your JavaScript code.

There are a few potential reasons why you might want to use Apache Cordova to build a web scraper:

1. `Cross-platform compatibility`: Cordova allows you to build applications that can run on
   multiple platforms, such as Web Browser, Android, iOS, and Windows, using a `single codebase`. This
   can be useful if you want your web scraper to be accessible on a wide range of devices.
2. `Ease of use`: Cordova uses familiar web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
   which may be easier for some developers to learn and use compared to native mobile
   development languages, such as Java or Swift.
3. `Integration with native features`: As mentioned above, Cordova provides access to
   native device features, such as the camera and GPS, which can be useful if you want to
   build a web scraper that utilizes these features.

Applications are typically built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and are packaged
as a native application using Cordova's build tools. When the application is launched, it
loads the HTML and JavaScript of your web app and runs it within a web view, which is
essentially a mini web browser that is embedded within the native application.

So while Cordova is primarily designed for building mobile applications, it can also be
used to build web-based applications that can run in a web browser, either as a standalone
application or as part of a mobile application.
